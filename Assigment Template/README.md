I think we should reorganize the structure as

1) Abstract, Intro, of course
2) Theories: Maths and Neural Networks
3) Preliminaries: Diffusion and Segmentation
4) Related works: I2SB and SegFormer
5) Method: our method based on Related works
6) Experiment
7) Summary, etc.

Currently refactor the section of Mathematical Analysis

Unclear

1) uniformly Lipschitz continuous
2) sample from a distribution
3) Ito process
4) product measure --> random vector is a tuple of random variable.
5) In the WdW example, whether introduce chi-squared?
6) Doobâ€™s Martingale Inequalities
7) Cauchy sequence in a norm space
8) the adjoint of an operator


Introduction to the Problem, state that we only need to remove visible watermarks.

\\d(?!frac)(?! )(?!ot)(?!raw)

Label types
1) theorem
2) definition
3) equation
4) lemma
5) proposition
6) example
7) figure
8) table



\emph{What is segmentation?} -> Definition
\emph{Why we need segmentation?} -> Narrative, place in pipeline
\emph{What type of segmentation we will use?} -> which model of segmentation.
