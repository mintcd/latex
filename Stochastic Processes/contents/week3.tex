\subsection*{Problem 2.} Suppose that $\Pi$ is a transition matrix of a Markov chain. Let $k\in\NN^*$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that $\Pi^k$ has identical rows. Show that $\Pi^n$ has identical rows for all $n\ge k$.
    \item Assume that $\Pi^k$ has a column all of whose elements are greater or equal to $\delta > 0$. Show that $\Pi^n$ has the same property for all $n \ge k$.
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Solution.} 

Let us map the state space $S$ to $\NN$ to simplify later arguments i.e $S = \{1,\cdots, N\}$ for some $N\in\NN$ or $S = \NN$.
\subsubsection*{1.} From the assumption, we have $\Pi^k_{i\ell} = \Pi^k_{j\ell}, \forall i,j,\ell\in S$. By induction, it is sufficient to show that $$\Pi^{k+1}_{i\ell}=\Pi^{k+1}_{j\ell}, \forall i,j,\ell\in S.$$
For any $i,j\in S$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \Pi^{k+1}_{i\ell} = \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\sup S} \Pi^{k}_{im} \Pi^{k}_{m\ell}  = \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\sup S} \Pi^{k}_{jm} \Pi^{k}_{m\ell} = \Pi^{k+1}_{j\ell},
\end{align*}

which completes the proof.

\subsubsection*{2.} Let $j_0$ be the column of $S$ such that $\Pi^k_{ij_0} \ge \delta > 0,\forall i\in S$. We have
\begin{align*}
\Pi^{k+1}_{ij_0} 
= \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\sup S} \Pi^{k}_{im} \Pi^{k}_{mj_0}
\ge \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\sup S} \Pi^{k}_{im} \delta
= \delta,
\end{align*}
since $\sum\limits_{m=1}^{\sup S} \Pi^{k}_{im}=1$. Therefore, the $j_0$-column of $\Pi^{k+1}$ also has all elements greater than or equal to $\delta$. By induction, the proof is completed.
