In our capstone project, we utilize semantic segmentation models and a diffusion-based model named Image-to-Image Schr√∂dinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) with an aim to remove visible watermarks out of original images. The work is attainable by the ability of diffusion models to transform a sample from one distribution to another. We proposed a comprehensive pipeline that processes a watermarked image and outputs an unwatermarked version while preserving the original structure of the image. Theoretical underpinnings of these models, namely stochastic differential equations and the widely-recognized Transformer architecture are also delved diligently into. 

\textbf{Keywords:} segmentation, diffusion-based models, watermark removal.
