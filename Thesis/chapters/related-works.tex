\section{Two-stage Watermark Removal}

The mentioned methods in the previous section mainly focus on transforming a watermarked image to an unwatermarked one, which we can think of as one-stage watermark removal. In this section, we discuss models relevant to our approach, including segmentation models (SegFormer and SAM) and a diffusion-based inpainting model (I$^2$SB). These models build up our two-stage watermark removal pipeline, which is discussed in details in Chapter \ref{chap:experiment}.
