\chapter{Mathematical Preliminaries}
\thispagestyle{empty}
In this chapter, we build step-by-step preliminaries in mathematical analysis that establish diffusion models. Discrete-time diffusion models are based on Markov chains, which is a stochastic process, and continuous-time are based on stochastic differential equations, both are derived from probability theory. Therefore, we begin by discussing the basics of mathematical analysis needed to develop formal probability theory. From probability theory, we study stochastic processes, stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations.
